# pico-torrent
A fast and small Torrent client made with Python 3.  

## History and context
It was programmed by a hacker known as Jazz\_Man, around January or February
2020, and later patched by me (Luiz Ant√¥nio) and by Caio Yoshimura, even
translated from portuguese to english by Vitor (`apocalipse`, not `vit0rr`).  

Althought being made with Otto in mind, it could be easily used as a standalone
Torrent client, so I took it from Otto's archived source tree and gave it its
own repository.  

## Chip in!

After all, this is not an abandonware, so please help us keeping it alive.  

## Licence
