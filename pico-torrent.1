.SH HISTORY
.PP
\f[B]pico-torrent\f[R] was created around January or February 2020 \[em]
meant to be a component of otto-pkg, which was a torrent-based
repository package manager that never in fact existed \[em] by a hacker
known as Jazz_Man.
Later, it was patched by me (Luiz Ant\[^o]nio), Caio Yoshimura and
translated by apocalipse from portuguese to english.
.PP
In 2022, it got an independent repository and began to be developed
again.
It recieved important fixes from Vitor Henrique (vitorhcl) since then.
.SH AUTHORS
.PP
Jazz_Man, at the Pindorama project.
.SH BUGS
.PP
For some reason in my tests/casual usage, magnet link support seems to
be broken.
pico-torrent will be stuck at \[lq]\f[B]downloading_metadata\f[R]\[rq]
when informing a magnet link instead of a \f[B].torrent\f[R] file.
This shall be fixed in a next release.
